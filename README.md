# Tetris

Tetris in [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/). Built to learn the basics of React so I'm not using [Redux](http://redux.js.org/) which would probably simplify state management quite a bit.

## Installation

1. To install the required dependencies:

```
yarn install
```

2. To run the webpack development server locally:

```
yarn start
```

## Build

```
yarn build
```

Note: If you just want to see the result: open `dist/index.html` in a browser.

## Bugs

- A ton

## Tests

- Nothing yet
